                <p>I am fairly new to web development, and enrolled in the University of Washington Full-stack Web Developer Bootcamp. My background and experience is largely in the arts. I have a BA in English. I started dabbling with writing code through edX as a hobby, which I quickly became fascinated by. <br><br> To me, you see, writing code is just another language- the syntax of computers. A bit different than English but a means of communication nonetheless. Code is the ability to use to language to create something tangible, rather than imaginative. I am excited to begin this journey, as foreign yet familiar as it may be, and explore the possibilities that lie ahead. </p>
